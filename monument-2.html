                <section class="monument-description">
                    <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine limestone, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and remains the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus.</p>
                    <p>The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, with an average audience of around 65,000. It was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era, and was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
                    <p>Despite the damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and has close connections with the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The structure's innovative design, including its complex system of vaults and arches, influenced architecture for centuries to come.</p>
