                <section class="monument-description">
                    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. Built during the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, this magnificent structure has stood for over 4,500 years, making it one of the oldest and most enduring monuments in human history. Originally standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.</p>
                    <p>The pyramid was constructed using approximately 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 to 15 tons. The precision with which these massive stones were cut and placed is remarkable, with the sides of the pyramid aligned almost perfectly with the four cardinal directions. The construction techniques used by the ancient Egyptians remain a subject of fascination and debate among archaeologists and engineers.</p>
                    <p>Inside the pyramid, a complex system of passages and chambers includes the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Grand Gallery. The pyramid was originally covered in smooth white limestone casing stones, which would have made it gleam brilliantly in the sunlight. Although most of these casing stones have been removed over the centuries, the pyramid continues to inspire awe and wonder, serving as a testament to the engineering prowess and architectural vision of ancient Egyptian civilization.</p>
