                <h1>Stonehenge</h1>
                <section class="monument-description">
                    <p>Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, two miles west of Amesbury. It consists of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing stones, each around 13 feet high, seven feet wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting horizontal lintel stones. Inside is a ring of smaller bluestones. Inside these are free-standing trilithons, two bulkier vertical sarsens joined by one lintel. The whole monument, now ruinous, is aligned towards the sunrise on the summer solstice.</p>
                    <p>Archaeologists believe that Stonehenge was constructed from around 3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first bluestones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC, although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC. The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of Stonehenge remains a subject of debate. Some theories suggest it was a burial ground, others propose it was a place of healing, and many believe it served as an astronomical observatory or calendar. The alignment with the solstices suggests it had significant ritual or ceremonial importance. The stones were transported from as far away as Wales, demonstrating the importance of this site to the people who built it. Today, Stonehenge continues to be a place of pilgrimage for druids, pagans, and tourists, attracting over 1.5 million visitors annually.</p>
